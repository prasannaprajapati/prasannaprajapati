## 2. Implementation Details

### ðŸ›  Verification Components
1. **AHB to APB Bridge**
   * Complete UVM-based verification environment

   * Data integrity checks
   * Error scenarios handling

2. **AHB Side Verification**

   * Idle cycles

2. **Advanced Features**
   * Burst transfers on AHB side
   * Wait state insertion
   * Error responses
   * Reset during transfer
   * Different transfer sizes

## 3. AHB Transfer Sequences

### ðŸ”¤ Base Sequence Class
```systemverilog
class master_seqs extends uvm_sequence #(master_xtn);
    `uvm_object_utils(master_seqs)
    
    logic [31:0] haddr;
    logic hwrite;
    logic [2:0] hsize;
    logic [2:0] hburst;
```

**Key Attributes:**
* Base class for all AHB transfer sequences
* Defines common transaction parameters
* Supports UVM sequence infrastructure

### ðŸ“¡ Single Transfer Sequence
**Implementation Features:**
* Non-sequential transfers (HTRANS=2'b01)
* Single transfer mode (HBURST=3'b000)
* Write operations (HWRITE=1'b1)
* Independent transfers without address incrementing

### ðŸ”¢ Increment Burst Sequence
**Supported Burst Types:**
* INCR4 (3'b011)
* INCR8 (3'b101)
* INCR16 (3'b111)
* INCR (3'b001)

**Address Calculation:**
```
New_Address = Previous_Address + (2^Size)
```

### ðŸ”„ Wrap Burst Sequence
**Supported Burst Types:**
* WRAP4 (3'b010)
* WRAP8 (3'b100)
* WRAP16 (3'b110)

**Boundary Calculations:**
```
Starting_addr = (haddr/((2^hsize) * Length)) * ((2^hsize) * Length)
Boundary_addr = Starting_addr + ((2^hsize) * Length)
```

**Example (WRAP4, 2-byte transfer):**
* Initial address: 24
* Starting address: (24/(4*2))*(4*2) = 24
* Boundary address: 24 + (2*4) = 32
* Sequence: 24 â†’ 26 â†’ 28 â†’ 30 â†’ 24 (wraps)

Comparing based on the Haddr, Paddr, and Hwdata, Pwdata
The key operation happens under these conditions:
1. Hwrite == 1: Indicates a write operation
2. Hwrite == 0: Indicates a read operation
3. Hsize == 2'b00: Specifies 1-byte data transfer (2^0 = 1 byte)
            2'b01: 2 bytes (16 bits)
            2'b10: 4 bytes (32 bits)
            2'b11: 8 bytes (64 bits)
   
Example-
Hwrite== 1
Hsize== 2'b00 (1bytes)
Haddr== 2e882088

Haddr== 2e 88 20 88
Byte position:    4      3      2      1
according to hsize it will going to select haddr byte, and from 1 byte it will select the 8=1000
last 2 bit data for data transfer, checking for last 2 bits
it will check for Haddr and Paddr if yes ADDRESS are sucessfully matching otherwise ADDRESS Mismatching

Hwdata=3e5f2294
Byte position:    4      3      2      1
Hex value:      3E     5F     22     94
2-bit value:    11     10     01     00
it will check for 94 value in Pdata if yes DATA are sucessfully matching otherwise DATA are NOT matching.
