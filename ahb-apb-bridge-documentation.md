## 1. Protocol Features

### ðŸš€ AMBA High-Performance Bus (AHB) Features
* High-performance, high-bandwidth protocol
* Pipelined operations support
* Multiple bus masters
* Burst transfers
* Split transactions
* Single-clock edge operation
* Non-tristate implementation
* Supports frequencies up to ~150MHz

## 2. Implementation Details

### ðŸ›  Verification Components
1. **AHB to APB Bridge**
   * Complete UVM-based verification environment
   * Protocol conversion verification
   * Data integrity checks
   * Error scenarios handling

2. **AHB Side Verification**
   * Master agent implementation
   * Protocol compliance checks
   * Burst transfer verification
   * Wait state handling

3. **APB Side Verification**
   * Slave response verification
   * Setup and enable phase checks
   * Error response handling
   * Transfer completion verification

### ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Transfers**
   * Single read/write operations
   * Back-to-back transfers
   * Idle cycles

2. **Advanced Features**
   * Burst transfers on AHB side
   * Wait state insertion
   * Error responses
   * Reset during transfer
   * Different transfer sizes

## 3. AHB Transfer Sequences

### ðŸ”¤ Base Sequence Class
```systemverilog
class master_seqs extends uvm_sequence #(master_xtn);
    `uvm_object_utils(master_seqs)
    
    logic [31:0] haddr;
    logic hwrite;
    logic [2:0] hsize;
    logic [2:0] hburst;
```

**Key Attributes:**
* Base class for all AHB transfer sequences
* Defines common transaction parameters
* Supports UVM sequence infrastructure

### ðŸ“¡ Single Transfer Sequence
**Implementation Features:**
* Non-sequential transfers (HTRANS=2'b01)
* Single transfer mode (HBURST=3'b000)
* Write operations (HWRITE=1'b1)
* Independent transfers without address incrementing

### ðŸ”¢ Increment Burst Sequence
**Supported Burst Types:**
* INCR4 (3'b011)
* INCR8 (3'b101)
* INCR16 (3'b111)
* INCR (3'b001)

**Address Calculation:**
```
New_Address = Previous_Address + (2^Size)
```

### ðŸ”„ Wrap Burst Sequence
**Supported Burst Types:**
* WRAP4 (3'b010)
* WRAP8 (3'b100)
* WRAP16 (3'b110)

**Boundary Calculations:**
```
Starting_addr = (haddr/((2^hsize) * Length)) * ((2^hsize) * Length)
Boundary_addr = Starting_addr + ((2^hsize) * Length)
```

**Example (WRAP4, 2-byte transfer):**
* Initial address: 24
* Starting address: (24/(4*2))*(4*2) = 24
* Boundary address: 24 + (2*4) = 32
* Sequence: 24 â†’ 26 â†’ 28 â†’ 30 â†’ 24 (wraps)
